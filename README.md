# LoL-statBuilder
This project aims to provide a way to build item sets for champions and see the corresponding stats at a given level and items for the purpose of theory crafting. Its not always practical to hop in side the practice tool. Further more it is not possible to compare builds and the stats they give and how expensive they are. My aim is to fill that gap
